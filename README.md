# Instrument-Classification-using-NSynth

This project was part of the Computational Music Analysis class at the Georgia Institute of Technology for fall 2017.

This project aimed at performing musical instrument classification using sparse coding and a support vector machine on the [Google NSynth dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth) which includes acoustic, electronic and synthetic sounds.

The detailed algorithm, implementation details, results and discussion can be found in the [final_report.pdf]() file.
