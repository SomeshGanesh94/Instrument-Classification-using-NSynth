# Instrument-Classification-using-NSynth

This project was part of the Computational Music Analysis class at the Georgia Institute of Technology for fall 2017. The report has been written in the [ISMIR 2017](https://ismir2017.smcnus.org/) template.

This project aimed at performing musical instrument classification using sparse coding and a support vector machine on the [Google NSynth dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth) which includes acoustic, electronic and synthetic sounds.

The detailed algorithm, implementation details, results and discussion can be found in the [final_report.pdf](https://github.com/SomeshGanesh94/Instrument-Classification-using-NSynth/blob/master/final_report.pdf) file.
